// This is a final report for the app that I made

// Used Android Concepts:

RecyclerView w/ click feedback
Buttons
Json Parsing
Json Object
Json Array
LinkedList
Alert Dialog(for the exit function)
IOstream (for reading Json as raw)

// Roadblocks

Actually to be honest, I spend more time dealing with depression and my feeling than making and debugging the app...
But if we only talk about the app, The json engine is harder to make than Me and my friend thought, we spent two weeks making it 
But ended up running out of time and cannot finish the game json file on time, but the engine is Completely bugfree for now 
and works as expected. 
I'm very proud of what I created, Json is a very flexible format and can be easily ported to different platform
The engine allows people to creates their own games with just a new game.json file, and it did not use any exist code online,
we started from scratch defining every code block and how it works. 
If I could have more time I will absolutely like to finish the game.json, but unfortunally this is what I can get so far.
I was planning to make the save/load/log to work... but as for now they remains WIP and unfunctional, I'm very Sorry.

// What I will do differently

Definally starting more early, I wasted a whole week just with depression alone, ended up with a layout for the first week which isn't
much.....
I will not be changing the scope of the project if I had more time for sure....

// advise to self

START EARLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
