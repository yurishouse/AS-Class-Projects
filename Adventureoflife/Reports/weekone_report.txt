This is the week one report for the final project, unfortunally, I didn't get enough time to do a lot due to 
psychological constraint (*had to deal with multiple anxiety attack due to personal event and ptsd)

I managed to get the layout sorted out for now, picked the color and made the style what I want it to be.
My friend suggest me to go with a clickable recycler view for the options, not sure if it's the best idea in the world
but oh well.

AS for the image, unfortunally I can't use what I had in mind due to copyright issues. and the free pics I found just 
aren't up to the task, So I abandoned the image for now.

I will be making the game engine with my friend together during the next week, will need to take a look at stuff to get
that sorted.

The background is a freebie I grubed from my friend's svg personal designs, So I can use it freely, it looks nice, isn't it

The color choices are intentional as to make the contrast better, I was origionally thinking about all lite pink but she 
think otherwise, so I'm  happy that this is sorted.
