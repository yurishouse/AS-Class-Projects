So, I wanted to make an TRPG style game that's loosely based on my life here in the US
I will likely be using SQL for text storage but might also just put it in a large jiva file, who knows...
The player will start in a normal room, with a limited hp(or mental points)
They will have to decide what is more important, school, life, getting help, or other things.
it will have at lease 3 chapter based on player interaction, the main character will be like me, depressed, without a
meaning for life.
The game logic is simple, you make choices with buttons, and try to find the meaning for life before getting eaten by depression and dies
I'm thinking about adding inventory and life system as well. maybe a ring around the interface telling people the state of 
the player.
winning senario can include but not limited to: finding the singificant other and complete the quest line, or have a very high
mental health point that you saved yourself.
Death senario can include losing all hp and die in suicide, getting prick by people around too much and losing control(hospital questline/end(?)),
 or player can ran into a dead end where they have no choice but to die.
there's will be pictures, from real life, probably r rated since I'm in no way trying to publish it to any official places. 
// I will include a disclaimer.h indicating it.
The game is dark, but also hopeful, I'm actually wanting to make it into a github release. to inspiring peoples, to find the 
meaning of their life.
